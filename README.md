## Description

This is a daily planner to keep track of tasks that need to be done throughout the day.

## Installation

N/A

# Usage

When the user types a task and hits the save button on the right of the time slot, the task will be stored. This task will be saved in local storage so the user can close the tab and reopen it with the tasks still there. The blocks that are green are hours that have already passed. The red block is the current hour. The gray blocks are future hours. The planner also tells you the current week day and todays date above the tasks.
